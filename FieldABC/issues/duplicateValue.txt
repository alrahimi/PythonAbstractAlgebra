Since Field is driving from both additive and multipicative group and each has it's own value (set by calling init) are there two values? Or two copies of each?
1-Fine out by inspecting
2-Remedy drive both additive and mulipcative Semigroups from one base which store a value

Resolved:
the following in testDistributive.py


    #verify iheriting from two semigroups with a 'v' member doesnt duplicate v
    print("\nprint r1 dic:")
    print("r1.__dict__=",r1.__dict__)
    print("End  r1 dic.Proves there is only one 'v'\n")
    

	
	prints
	
print r1 dic:
r1.__dict__= {'modulus': 11, 'v': 21}
End  r1 dic.Proves there is only one 'v'
